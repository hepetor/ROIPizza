# :pizza: ROIPizza :pizza:

README in progress...

Hobby project for learning C# and creating a possibly useful application for choosing which pizzeria I should visit. 

### Working on this project only on my free time when feeling like it.

TODO:

##
- Check file usage when adding large amount of pizzerias
##
- Delete empty files from the pizzeria files
##
- Fix user inputs (Ignore empty or incorrect user inputs) 
##
- Exception handling
##
- Remove "duplicated" code (create just one method for some parts)
##
- Add readonly parameters

(extra, when done):
- Add pizzeria opening hours?
- Add mayonnaise availablity?
- Find all the pizzeria info
- Tests?
- Graphic interface ? --> new project
