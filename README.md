# ROIPizza
README in progres...

Hobby project for learning C# and in the future possible useful application for choosing which pizzeria I should visit. 

TODO:
- Functionality of course...

- Find all the pizzeria info
- Visited/Not visited pizzerias into own file, in order for the program to remember user changes (keep the full file aswell)
- Removing / Editing pizzeria info from the command line
- Remove "duplicated" code (create just one method for some parts)
- Add readonly parameters 

- Tests?
- Graphic interface ? --> new project
