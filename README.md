# ROIPizza
README in progres...

Hobby project for learning C# and in the future possible useful application for choosing which pizzeria I should visit. 

TODO:
- Functionality of course...

- Add formatter for the code (to make it look more clean)  Ctrl+K, Ctrl+F
- Find all the pizzeria info
- Store pizzeria's into file? Easier for array/list handling?
