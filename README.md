# :pizza: ROIPizza :pizza:

README in progres...

Hobby project for learning C# and creating a possibly useful application for choosing which pizzeria I should visit. 

### Working on this project only on my free time when feeling like it.

TODO:

- Editing pizzeria info from the command line
- Fix user inputs (Ignore empty or incorrect user inputs) 
- Exception handling
- Remove "duplicated" code (create just one method for some parts)
- Add readonly parameters 



- Add pizzeria opening hours?
- Find all the pizzeria info
- Tests?
- Graphic interface ? --> new project
